        <h1>Sea<br><span>Food</span></h1>
        <p>The harvesting of wild seafood is usually known as fishing or hunting, while the cultivation and farming of seafood is known as aquaculture or fish farming (in the case of fish). Seafood is often colloquially distinguished from meat; vegetarians who consume seafood as the only source of meat are said to adhere to pescetarianism. Seafood is an important source of (animal) protein in many diets around the world, especially in coastal areas.</p>

        <h1>SPICY PRAWN FRY<br><span>DISH</span></h1>
        <p> Prawn fry recipe is a seafood dish to try out and 
          prawns fry is shallow fried in a little bit of oil
          and I must say the recipe turned out amazing. I 
          basically, try my hands at fish and when I tried 
          my hands on making prawn fry I was amazed at its 
          taste.Many tend to cook prawns without cleaning
          and removing the intestinal tract as it is not
          extremely harmful but I would suggest removing 
          them as it contains all the impurities which may
          affect in the long run with regular consumption.</p>

        <h1>CRAB<br><span>DISH</span></h1>
        <p>Toasting whole spices and aromatics in oil over low heat helps draw out fat-soluble flavor compounds and triggers complex reactions that improves their aroma.
          We cook the spiced tomato mixture until the fat breaks out into droplets on the surface. This is an indication that the moisture content has reduced sufficiently to intensify flavors.</p>
